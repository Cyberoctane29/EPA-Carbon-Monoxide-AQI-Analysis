    "As a member of an analytics team for the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), I have been assigned to analyze air quality data with respect to carbon monoxide, a major air pollutant. The dataset includes information from more than 200 monitoring sites across various states, counties, and cities. By applying statistical techniques, I will explore patterns, detect outliers, and conduct hypothesis testing to generate meaningful insights. These findings will help inform environmental policy decisions, identify regions requiring intervention, and assess how air quality trends impact public health strategies.\n"

    "- **state_name**: The U.S. state where the air quality was measured.  \n",
    "- **county_name**: The county where the monitoring site is located.  \n",
    "- **city_name**: The city (if applicable) where the air quality was recorded.  \n",

    "- **parameter_name**: The pollutant measured, which in this case is carbon monoxide.  \n",
    "- **units_of_measure**: The unit used for measurement (Parts per million).  \n",
    "- **arithmetic_mean**: The average concentration of carbon monoxide for the given date and location.  \n",
    "- **aqi**: The Air Quality Index (AQI) value derived from the carbon monoxide concentration.  \n",

    "#### **Dataset 2-c4_epa_air_quality.csv: Log-Transformed AQI Data**  \n",

    "- **date_local, state_name, county_name, city_name, local_site_name, parameter_name, units_of_measure** (same as Dataset 1).  \n",
    "- **aqi_log**: The natural logarithm of the AQI value for improved statistical analysis.  \n",

    "In this section, we utilize descriptive statistics to analyze and summarize air quality data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), uncovering patterns and trends that support informed decision-making on environmental policies and public health initiatives. By employing Python libraries such as **pandas** and **numpy**, we compute key statistical measures—including **mean, median, standard deviation, and percentiles**—to understand the central tendencies and variability of AQI values. Through this exploration, we emphasize the crucial role of descriptive statistics in data interpretation and effective communication of findings."
